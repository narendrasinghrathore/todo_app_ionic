Todo application using ionic v4 angular v7 and firebase as our backend server.

This application manages it's state using own implementation of Rxjs BehaviorSubject.

We are using firebase realtime database for storing all our json data.

We divide components in two categories
1) Stateful
2) Stateless

We have currently 
1) Home component which display all data at once
2) Profile page that store information of use
3) About page, nothing much
4) Register
5) Login
